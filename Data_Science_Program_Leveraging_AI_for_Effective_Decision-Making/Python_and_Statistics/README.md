  <blockquote>
    The primary goal of this course was to understand how to work with data and extract observations and insights from it. This       course also focused on some fundamental statistical concepts required to draw meaningful inferences from data. The course         gives the good foundations in both Python and statistics that are needed to better appreciate the subsequent courses in this      program.
